# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain tumor images. The notebook guides through the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing it, constructing the CNN model, training it, and evaluating its performance. This README provides an overview of the notebook's structure, key features, and requirements.

## Project Overview
Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical image analysis. This project focuses on using a deep learning approach (CNN) to automatically identify the presence of tumors in MRI scans.

### Key Features

   - Image loading, resizing, and normalization.
   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **CNN Architecture:**
   - Model definition using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
   - Includes convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Compiling the model with a suitable optimizer and loss function.
   - Training the model while monitoring performance metrics.
   - Visualizing accuracy and loss trends.

4. **Results Visualization:**
   - Displaying sample predictions.
   - Confusion matrix and classification report.
